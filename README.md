# rn-assignment3-11116926

This was an assignment that required us to duplicate a mock up UI using React Native and Expo Go. In my app, I used the following components:

- **View** - Used to create sections in the app.  
- **Text** - Used to render text elements in the app.
- **ScrollView** - USed to allow user to see the parts of the app that does not fit on the screen in the category and ongoing tasks sections.
- **TextInput** - Used in the search bar to allow user input from keyboard.
- **Stylesheet** - Used to design all parts of the app.
- **FlatList** -  Used to renderr the ongoing tasks section.

Below are some screenshots of the app:
